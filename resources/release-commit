# Update this commit manually when packaging a new release
# If it differs from `ci-commit-previous`, the ci commit is
# shown next to the version number to indicate a nightly release.
#
# Inserting the hash of the current commit would be... difficult,
# and so this is compared against `HEAD~1`'s hash instead. Then,
# `HEAD`'s commit is actually shown when these differ.
#
# To get the short hash, run `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.
# Update this file and then commit. The CI output from that commit
# is then the official release for that version and won't show
# the commit hash in the TETR.IO PLUS window.
